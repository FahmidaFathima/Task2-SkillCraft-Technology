# Task 02: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Objective:
Develop a K-means clustering algorithm to segment retail store customers into distinct groups based on their purchase behavior using the Mall Customer Dataset. This segmentation will help identify customer patterns and improve targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset Overview:
The Mall Customer Dataset contains data such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. By clustering this data, the algorithm can group customers into meaningful segments, such as high spenders, budget shoppers, or young shoppers, for personalized marketing and enhanced customer service.
